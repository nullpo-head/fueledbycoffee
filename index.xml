      <description>Have you ever designed your own ISA, built a processor of that ISA on FPGA, and built a compiler for it? Furthermore, have you run an operating system on that processor? Actually, we have.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about my undergraduate days in 2015, our four months of building a home-built CPU of a home-built RISC ISA, building a home-built C toolchain, and porting Xv6, a Unix-like OS, to that CPU.</description>
